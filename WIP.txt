WORK IN PROGRESS
================


Recursive Patterns :
-  pure patterns : have two basic kinds (I and P) and ensure
   not much overlap in the sizes which can use them
   (in particular : I pattern should be tall and narrow)

-  figure out how symmetry works with recursive patterns

-  support "huge" patterns : these specify a size string which
   automatically expands to fill the w/h of room

   x_big_size = "626"  ---> 939 in a 21 seed wide room

   [ '1' never expands, '2' sometimes becomes '3' (rarely: '4')
     '3' can become '4' or '5' or '6'
     '4' and above will expand to as big as necessary ]
   
-  new pattern char '?' which means "don't care" / "filler"
   the chunk (usually) becomes same as a nearby sub-area cell
   if installed on a conn (etc), transmit "must_walk" to neighbor

-  when stair goes INTO a sub-area, it means all its floors
   should have HIGHER vhr than any in the outer pattern
   (or LOWER vhr than any in outer pattern)

   --> stair_mode field, can be "up", "down", "flat", "random"

   if stair into sub-area would hit multiple floors, then
   pick _LOW_ one when stair goes up, and _HIGH_ one when
   stair goes down.

   disallow stairs FROM a sub-area (e.g. "aa>..")

-  patterns which mix normal floors and sub-areas are problematic,
   since the normal floor may be separated into 2+ distinct areas,
   hence need either:
   (a) explicit stairs
   (b) _OR_ more analysis code to detect the separate regions of
       each floor (meh)
   (c) _OR_ disallow having separate areas (need analysis code to
       validate them)

IDEA: recurse = "onion" patterns, and we try a small quota of
      there BEFORE all other patterns.

IDEA: fence patterns (place a fence between two sub-areas and/or
      between a normal area <-> sub-area)
      _OR_ pick a certain floor to be "fenced"

+  divide non-rectangular rooms (currently only parent rooms)
   into rectangles and use same "intra connection" logic as for
   pure recursive patterns.

   --> thereby create chunks for ALL non-cave rooms


3D Floors:
!!  fix lighting

+  SEED.k_top  :  number of chunks in chunk[]

+  light from above can "go right through"

-  next to room with liquid -- odd gap is possible

+  in patterns, specify number of 3D components (default to 1)
   and include them all in the 'structure' field.

   For example:

      layers = 4

      structure =
      {
        "...",  "111",  "2>3",  "   "
        "1<.",  "  v",  "2  ",  "  3"
        "2..",  "  2",  "22 ",  "333"
      }

      AND HENCE : _structure becomes a three dimensional array


Chunks:
!!  completely decide what a chunk is, and how much representation
    cunrrently in seeds should to be moved into chunks.
    e.g. all 'S.floor_h' be replaced with 'S.chunk[1].floor.h' ??

-  give lower chunk (if two) a ceil_h

-  CHUNK_CLASS ?   put in seed.lua

-  CHUNK.content (not SEED.content)

-  link chunks together

-  split big chunks: 4 = 2/2  5 = 2/1/2 or 1/3/1  6 = 2/2/2  (etc)
   (maintain symmetry if chunk straddles middle of room)

-  split any chunks which contain TWO importants or conns
   (detect if horiz or vertical, and where)

-  often merge 1x2 or 2x2 seeds with exact same floors (and no stairs etc)
   into a single chunk  --  try 2x2 before 1x2 / 2x1


Layout rework:
+  get curved stairs working again

+  get diagonals working again

-  sometimes make a floor use same material as top (not room wall)


Junking:
-  caves: sometimes junk a side or two
   - only at edge of map (?)
   - 1 or 2 seeds deep

-  normal junking : upto 2 seeds at edge of map


Closets and Traps:
-  can use unused seeds [inside map area]
-  can use junked parts of a room
-  can use a SOLID seed in a pattern (c.f. cage code)

-  can steal part of a nearby scenic, but require all three sides
   (and two diagonals) to remain part of scenic room


Doors
-  Door_with_bars : use it
+  make a dark-metal switch for Door_with_bars
-  make a two seed wide door prefab
-  support wide doors [normal / locked]
-  make wide prefab with a switch in it [normal door]
-  texturing on door prefabs (for HELL, URBAN themes)



MISCELLANEA
===========


RAIL ISSUE : cannot control offsets on BACK SIDE of a brush vert
--->  test new logic....

Wrong texturing when pillar (underneath a 3D bridge) intersects

Review spot handling in Cave code

rocky_exit : switch can be stretched
